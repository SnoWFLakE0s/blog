# Repasting my T14
---
I repasted the thermals on my ThinkPad T14 Gen 1 (AMD). I began with opening the bottom case up, having something like a guitar pick helps open the clips.

After opening, remove the screws on the heatsink and disconnect the fan cable.

Old crusty thermals. Clean the old paste off. Modern art, almost. Super pretty.

The heatsink module, removed.

Apply thermal paste, lay it over the entire chip. Reattach heatsink.

Runs nice and cool now. Around 37C doing normal web based tasks. Pretty nice for a 4750U.
