# Royal Kludge Sink87G Disassembly

1. Begin by removing all screws. There are 3 screws on the back case, one exposed, and two under each keyboard foot. The feet can be canted slightly as it is pulled to be removed for easier screw access.

2. Remove the top case. It is a little easier to open if you slide a guitar pick between the top and bottom case. Remove keycaps as pictured to gain access to top plate screws. Remove all screws.

3. Lift top plate and PCB out of the lower case. I added some foam tape all over mine. As this board is soldered there was no way to the remove the top plate, which appears to be a roughly 22 or 20 gauge painted steel sheet.

Some closer shots of the overall PCB. Based on unpopulated slots there seems to be a version of this that has a BT connection.

You do need to remove the battery and daughterboard connection to lift out the PCB and top plate.

Battery is a 3.7V, 1850mAh LiPo cell. Standard JST PH 2-pin for the battery. I reckon you could replace the battery with something else. There is also the daughterboard for the USB-C plug, which appears to be a JST-SH connector. The overall structure of the molded bottom case shows the structural ridges, standoffs, the magnetized dock for the 2.4GHz receiver, and a cutout for the ON/OFF switch.

I realize now that I neglected to note the MCU that controls the board, but it was some generic MCU. I might update this log if I crack the board open again.
